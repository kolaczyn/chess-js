# TODOs

## Make it more reponsive 
Hide a row/ column label when the screen is getting small etc.

## Reset Button
Wire the reset button. Will still not work, because function which intializes pieces doesn't clear rows 3rd to 6th.


## Row Col should be object
I should rewrite the code, so sqIdToRowCol, returns an object e.g. {row: 0, col:0}, instead of [0, 1]

## Naming Convention
Finally decide how you want to call your variables and follow through with it.
