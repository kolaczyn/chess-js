# TODOs

## Make it more reponsive 
Hide a row/ column label when the screen is getting small etc.

## The board's rotation
If I rotate the board after each turn, I have to keep the turn's indicators at the bottom of the page. Or let the user decide if he want the board to rotate after each turn.

## Reset Button
Wire the reset button. Will still not work, because function which intializes pieces doesn't clear rows 3rd to 6th.

## Selected piece indicator
Wire it up.

## Classes don't make sense
I should restructured the code even more.

## Fix assets
Change PNG to SVG. Don't use seperate assets for black and white pieces. Add proportions and fix the pieces' margins.

## Webpack
Stop using VS Code's extensions. Also, add eslint

## Finally add some logic
Really, what are you waiting for?
